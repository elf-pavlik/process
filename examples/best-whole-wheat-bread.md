Dave Miller’s Basic Whole Wheat Bread

Using [Baker's Percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage), in which each of the ingredients is specified as a percentage of the flour ingredient by weight.

### Inputs

* whole wheat flour 100%

* water (102% of flour weight, though extra dry flour may call for 105%). Use 90% of the water for the Autolease process, save 10% for the next step.

## Process: Autolease:

Mix the flour with 90% of the water in a bowl. Let sit for 30 minutes–a lapse of time called the”autolease,” during which enzymes activate and convert starches into sugar.

### Output/Input:

* autoleased dough

### Other inputs:

* 10% of the water
* sourdough starter 2%
* salt .025%

## Process: Mix final dough:

Next, mix the dough in an automatic mixer or by hand for several minutes. Add the remaining water, sourdough starter and salt. The dough will be very gooey–almost like batter. Allow it to sit for three hours in a bowl at room temperature.

### Output/Input:

 * Final dough

## Process: Form loaves:

Next break apart the dough and shape into loaves. Allow 20 minutes of rising. Punch down the dough loaves and allow one more rise. 

### Output/Input: 

* Loaves

 ## Process: Bake:

After three hours, place in an oven preheated to 520 degrees F (yes–this is very hot). After 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 470 for 20 minutes. For 15 more minutes, open the oven door a crack, which allows moisture to escape and facilitates crust formation. Remove the finished bread.

### Output: 

* Finished bread.
